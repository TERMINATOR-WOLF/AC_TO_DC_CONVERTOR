Conversion from AC to DC
1. Rectification: Rectification is the process of converting AC to pulsating DC. It involves using diodes to allow current to flow in only one direction.

There are two main types of rectifiers:
Half-Wave Rectification: In this method, only one half of the AC waveform is allowed to pass through, resulting in a DC output with a significant amount of ripple.
Full-Wave Rectification: This method utilizes either a bridge rectifier or a center-tapped transformer along with diodes to convert both halves of the AC waveform into DC, resulting in a smoother output with less ripple.
2. Inverters and Converters: In some cases, AC can be converted to DC by first converting it to a different form of AC using an inverter and then rectifying the AC output to obtain DC. This approach is common in renewable energy systems, where DC power from sources such as solar panels or wind turbines is converted to AC for use in the electrical grid.

Covert AC to DC
To convert AC to DC, the voltage is first stepped down using a transformer. Then, rectifiers are used for the conversion. A common method is the full-bridge rectifier, which uses four diodes arranged to allow current flow during both halves of the AC cycle. In the positive half-cycle, two diodes conduct, and in the negative half-cycle, the other two diodes conduct, effectively flipping the negative half into positive. This process converts the AC supply into a pulsating DC supply.
